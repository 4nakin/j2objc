This package creates an Objective-C library of JUnit's framework classes.
It also has the junit.textui.TestRunner and junit.runner package, to run
unit tests as it's done with Java.

This project's only Java files are those that were modified from the
original JUnit release. The other JUnit source files are extracted from
the JUnit source jar when building.

Modifications:
. The main method was removed from junit.runner.Version, since Obj-C
  libraries can only have one main() function.
. A signal handler was added to junit.textui.TestRunner to report
  uncaught exceptions and failures.
